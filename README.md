A curated collection of **small Java applications** based on **real-world scenarios** to practice:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Clean code principles
- Logical problem solving
- Basic software architecture

This repository is intended for **learning by building**, where each project simulates a real business or system case using Java.

## 📦 Projects Included

Each project is independent and focuses on a specific real-world domain:

| Project                  | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧾 Cashier System        | Simulates a food & beverage ordering system with receipt and discounts |
| 🏠 Boarding House System | Manages room occupancy and tenant data                                 |
| 📦 Inventory System      | Tracks product stock and updates quantities                            |
| ⏳ Queue System          | Simulates a queue mechanism for customers or tasks                     |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through these projects, you will learn how to:

- Design classes using OOP principles
- Separate business logic from user interface
- Handle user input and validation
- Build modular and maintainable code
- Simulate real-world processes using Java

### ▶️ How to Run a Project

1. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd src/com/cashier
```

2. Compile:

```bash
javac *.java
```

3. Run:

```bash
java Main
```

Replace `cashier` with any other project folder.
